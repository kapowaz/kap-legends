# Production Files

This directory contains the exported SVG assets that were used to create the CAD
models used in the production of the final keycap molds. They’re provided here
for two reasons:

1. As a ‘source of truth’ for legends to provide to Keyreative
2. As a reference for other designers, to see how the legends were created

Designers wishing to create their own keycap legends for use with KAP Legend
System should refer to the Designers Guide templates rather than using these
production files directly, as the former have been designed with this specific
goal in mind.
