# Getting Started

The best way to design and manage keycap sets made with KAP Legend System is
using [Figma][figma]. This is what we use to build the legends, keycaps, kits
and templates internally, and you will benefit from all the same internal tools
and workflows we have when you use Figma to build your sets.

:::info

Figma is a cross-platform collaboration-oriented design tool that runs either
from a desktop application or a modern web browser; if you don’t already have an
account you can [create a basic account for free][figma-signup].

## Recommended Plugins

Figma can extend its functionality with third-party plugins; several of these
are particularly useful when working with KAP templates. You can install them by
visiting their community pages, linked below.

- [KAP Legend System][figma-plugin-kap-legend-system]: you will need this plugin
  to export keycap lists for production.
- [Automator][figma-plugin-automator]: allows you to perform the same action to
  each of a set of different selected layers, such as changing alignment,
  boolean operations and adding a frame around each layer
- [Similayer][figma-plugin-similayer]: makes selecting all objects within a
  frame (or the whole page) matching certain properties very easy. Essential for
  selecting keycap component instances or their constituent parts
- [Sort Layers][figma-plugin-sort-layers]: useful for sorting a large number of
  layers by name, which can be very helpful in some scenarios, such as exporting
- [Find & replace variables][figma-plugin-find-replace-variables] (non-free):
  extremely useful for changing all references to a particular variable (or set
  of variables, by name) to another variable. It can save a lot of time for
  repetitive tasks (you can install it and use it 3 times for free to try it
  out).

## Requesting Access

Once you’ve created a Figma account, there are two template files you will need
access to: you can visit these URLs to request permission to view them

- [KAP Production Templates][kap-production-templates]
- [KAP Template][kap-template]

The first of these contains many of the shared components you’ll need (which
will allow you to customise your template), but the second file is the most
important one: this is a template for an individual keycap set project. You
don’t need Edit access to these files; you will make all your changes in your
own copy of the KAP Template file.

:::tip

If you’re having trouble getting access to the template files, ask on <DiscordLink />.

## Setting up a new project

Once you have access, Duplicate the file `KAP Template` Your new file will be
given the name `KAP Template (Copy)` — you can rename it from the same context
menu, directly below _Duplicate_.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src={figmaDuplicateContextMenu}
    alt="A screenshot from Figma showing the contextual menu to Duplicate a file"
    width={390}
  />
</p>

Give it an appropriate name (i.e. `KAP My Project`), then open the Local
variables by clicking the sliders icon in the right hand panel:

<p align="center">
  <img
    src={figmaVariablesIcon}
    alt="A screenshot from Figma showing the location of the Local variables icon"
    width={259}
  />
</p>

From here, double click on the text _KAP Template_ alongside Project Name, and
enter your chosen name. This will update all instances within the document where
the project name appears, including the cover page and packaging templates.

  <img
    src={figmaVariablesPanelProjectName}
    alt="A screenshot from Figma showing the variables panel"

  />
