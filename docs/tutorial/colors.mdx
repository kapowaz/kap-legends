# Colors

To make an interesting keycap set, you will need to choose a color scheme. This
can be a fully-involved process with steps including choosing physical colors,
color matching samples and creating accurate renders. However, before you
undertake any of that, your first task with a new project template should be to
set up _representative_ colors to help you visualize your kits and the overall
theme.

## Variables

The KAP Legend System templates make heavy use of a feature in Figma called
_variables_. If you’re not familiar with the concept from computer programming,
you may benefit from reading Figma’s own [documentation on
variables][figma-variables].

Variables are a way of creating a named _reference_ to a _value_ (in this case:
a color); you can then use the same named reference in multiple places within a
Figma file. When the underlying value changes, all places that color is used
will automatically update, making it much easier to keep your design in sync.

Additionally, Figma allows you to use a variable as the value for _another_
variable. In the context of the KAP Template, this means that you can define a
set of named colors (_Dark Beige_, _Light Beige_, _Orange_ etc.) with
corresponding hexadecimal color values, and then assign those variables to
other named variables like _Alpha Legend_ (which is the color used for the
alpha key legends).

## Key Variables

In the template, there are several important variables you will encounter, each
of which controls the default colors for three different types of keycap:
Alpha, Modifier and Accent:

- `Keys/Alpha Legend`
- `Keys/Alpha Base`
- `Keys/Alpha Highlight`
- `Keys/Modifier Legend`
- `Keys/Modifier Base`
- `Keys/Modifier Highlight`
- `Keys/Accent Legend`
- `Keys/Accent Base`
- `Keys/Accent Highlight`

In each of these the variable ending `Legend` controls the colors of legends on
this type of keycap, `Base` controls the overall color of the keycap base, and
`Highlight` controls the shading for the keycap top (in most cases this will be
either white or black, and may not need to be changed).

  />
</p>

From within the variables panel you can click on the assigned color on the right
for any of these values, and choose any another named color. To create a new
color you can either click the _+ Create variable_ button at the bottom of the
panel, or you can right click an existing color and choose _Duplicate variable_
from the context menu.

:::warning

Note that if you change the underlying color value for a named color, it will
update _all_ places that color is being used, potentially including places you
don’t want to update. For that reason it’s usually better to create a new color
variable, and update specific places to reference that new variable instead.

## Adding colors

If your set doesn’t follow the template’s pattern of alpha, modifier and accent
keys, you will probably want to create additional color variables to help you
represent different types of keycap within your set, and to ensure all of these
update if your colors change.

One of the easiest ways of adding a new color is to simply duplicate an existing
one, by right-clicking it within the Variables panel:

<p align="center">
  <img
    src={figmaDuplicateVariableContextMenu}
    alt="A screenshot from Figma of the variables panel, showing the context menu action for Duplicate highlighted"
    width={642}
  />
</p>

You can then safely change the underlying color of your new variable without
affecting anywhere else the existing variable is used. To give yourself even
more flexibility (and protect against unintentional mistakes) you can also
create variables that point to other variables, and then assign this indirected
variable to keycaps when you customise their color.

:::tip

Figma visually groups variables by their name (e.g. _Colors_ and _Keys_ in the
KAP Template). Using a forward slash as a separator in the name of a variable
will cause it to be displayed as a visual group, so: `Colors/Mauve` will create
a color called _Mauve_ which is visually grouped under _Colors_.

## Physical Colors

Once you reach the manufacturing stage, you will need to provide Keyreative with
a set of production files that show which parts of which keys are what _physical
color_ (for example: Pantone or RAL color codes). The best way of indicating
which physical colors your sets use is to update the _Color Key_ in your kit
diagrams. You can find this within the _Kit Color Codes_ component on the _Kit
Diagrams_ page.

Once you’ve chosen your physical colors you can double-click on the names within
the top-right of the component to edit them, and update the swatch to the
corresponding color variable.
