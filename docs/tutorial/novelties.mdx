# Novelties

To complement your keycap set, you may want to augment it by creating a Novelty
Kit. This can often significantly increase the appeal of your set, helping to
reinforce your chosen theme.

## Kitting

If you’re experienced in creating novelty kits you can skip this section, but
for everyone else here is some guidance on how to approach kitting your novelty
kit. There are a few main ways people use novelty keys on mechanical keyboards:

1. Replacements for (primarily bottom row) modifiers
2. Replacement for the R4 Escape key (common on a 60% or 65% layout)
3. 1u macro keys for ‘XT’-style key clusters, or function row keys

This means your safest bets for keys to include in a novelty kit are:

- R4 1.0u
- R1 1.0u
- R1 1.25u
- R1 1.5u
- R2 1.75u (i.e. ‘Caps Lock’)
- R2 2.25u (i.e. ANSI Enter)
- ISO Enter

Typically for the R1 keys, you should offer one of each size for _each_
novelty design you offer; if you only have one novelty design for this key,
offer at least two of each size.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src={noveltiesBasicKitting}
    alt="An example kitting diagram for basic novelties keys"
    width={459}
  />
</p>

For macro keys, there are a couple of different ways of approaching this. You
can either provide a number of R4 1.0u keys (which would for example allow
replacing all four keys above the numpad cluster on a 105-key layout), _or_ you
can provide 1-2 keys per row from R4-R2, and 2-4 keys on R1 (this allows for a
2x5 arrangement as seen in an XT key cluster). Some users are happy to use
all-R4 keys in a vertical arrangement for an XT key cluster (as is often done
with F-row keys), so you could alternatively provide 5-10 R4 1.0u keys to
achieve the same outcome.

    src={noveltiesR4Kitting}
    alt="An example kitting diagram for basic novelties keys"
    width={270}
  />
</p>

## Custom Keys

The best way of creating your new kit is to start out by finding instances of
the size and row of keycap you want to use within the KAP Template file, and
creating a new component based on it. Let’s say for example we want to create a
R1 1.25u novelty key; first <Kbd mod="meta">Click</Kbd> in the middle of the
left-most Control key on the bottom row of the Base Kit.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src={figmaSelectedControlKey}
    alt="A kitting diagram from the Base Kit template, with the Inner Edge layer of the keycap selected and highlighted in purple"
    width={940}
  />
</p>

In the left-hand panel you should see a selected layer called _Inner Edge_,
which sits nested within several other components, leading up to one called
`R1-Ctrl 1.25 Modifier`. This is the component you want to copy, so select it
and press <Kbd mod="meta">C</Kbd> to copy it.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src={figmaControlKeyComponentLayers}
    alt="A screenshot of the Figma layers panel, showing the Inner Edge layer selected"
    width={381}
  />
</p>

:::info

Most keys within the KAP Template follow the same overall structure, but a
couple of them are exceptions to the rule: notably the Escape keys, Enter 2.0
Vertical key (used in the Numpad) and NumLock key. To make it easier to switch
between modifier variants for these keys, the instances you will find within the
Base Kit templates wrap around the actual keycap instance. So for example, the
Escape Accent key on R4 is called `R4-Esc Accent` but the _actual_ key component
within it will be called `R4-Esc Icon Accent` (or `R4-Esc Text Accent`, if
you’ve switched to that variant). If you’re using one of these as the basis for
a new novelty, ensure you copy the key _inside_ the outer component (e.g.
`R4-Esc Icon Accent`).

:::

Create a new page within your Figma file by clicking the + icon at the upper
part of the left-hand panel; give it a name like _Novelties_, then paste your
target component with <Kbd mod="meta">V</Kbd>. For now this is just another
ordinary _instance_ of the `R1-Ctrl 1.25u Modifier` component, so let’s turn it
into a new component, independent of its origins.

To do this, first we want to _Detach Instance_ with <Kbd mod={['option',
'meta']}>B</Kbd>, then create a new component from it with <Kbd mod={['option',
'meta']}>K</Kbd>. At this point you should give it a suitable name, following
the same naming structure, e.g. `R1-Novelty Cat 1.25 Modifier`.

:::tip

By convention, some keycap components will have a suffix of _Modifier_ or
_Accent_ to denote that they use the Modifier or Accent colors; if you’re
planning on using Modifier or Accent colors for your novelties, choose the
appropriate name here. If on the other hand you’re using the same color scheme
for alpha keys and modifiers, feel free to drop the suffix from your keycap
component.

:::

Within your newly-created component, the first (and only) thing inside it will
be an instance of a component `.Generic Keys/Ctrl 1.25`; select it, and as
before press{' '} <Kbd mod={['option', 'meta']}>B</Kbd> to detach the
instance, then <Kbd mod={['shift', 'meta']}>G</Kbd> to ungroup its contents.
Once this is done, you should have something that looks a little like this:

<p align="center">
  <img
    src={figmaCatNoveltyLayers01}
    alt="A screenshot of the Figma layers panel, showing the contents of the new Cat Novelty keycap component"
    width={381}
  />
</p>

You can select each of these items and see how it fits into the component, and
if you choose to, you can remove them. If however you’re following the standard
modifier key layout (recommended so your keys fit the overarching aesthetic of
KAP Legend System) and are planning on substituting the default icon with
something of your choosing, you should probably keep at least the icon in place
to use as a placeholder. We’ll discuss how to go about this in the section on
Icons, below.

## Icons

The standard layout within KAP Legend System keycaps uses an 18×18 frame size
for icons (although in some special cases, parts of the icon may extend beyond
the edges of this frame). If you’re creating a novelty which includes text, we
recommend you start with this same 18×18 frame for your icon; for icon or
pictographic-only novelty keys, feel free to use whatever size makes sense for
you.

For now we’ll assume you’re creating a set of novelty keys all of which will
have the same design, at different sizes (for 1.0u, 1.25u and 1.5u). First,
create a new frame that will serve as the canvas for your icon by pressing
&nbsp;<Kbd>F</Kbd> then dragging out an 18×18 frame. In the right-hand panel,
uncheck _Clip content_, and remove the default Fill color of `#FFFFFF` by
clicking the minus icon to the right.

<p align="center">
  <img src={figmaCatFaceFrame} alt="A screenshot of an empty square frame in Figma" width={514} />
</p>

Now, add an icon within the frame and call it something like `18px/Cat Face`.
You can draw this however you like (with important consideration to the
_Tolerances_, discussed below), but you should ensure the icon is grouped within
a _Boolean Union_ — you do this with <Kbd mod={['shift', 'option']}>U</Kbd> —
name this union `Icon`, and in the _Appearance_ properties in the right-hand
panel set the border radius to `0.14`. This will ensure that any sharp edges
from your design are smoothed out, and that the icon has a consistent fill color
when substituted for any other icon instance.

:::info

If you’re using Keyreative’s hybrid doubleshot approach and have an icon which
uses multiple different colors, you can skip the step to group all of your
icon’s components into a single Boolean union. You should still ensure that each
layer has a border radius of `0.14`, however.

:::

<p align="center">
  <img
    src={figmaCatFaceBoolean}
    alt="A screenshot of the Figma interface showing a set of layers for the cat icon"
    width={568}
  />
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img
    src={figmaCatIconLayers}
    alt="A screenshot of the Figma interface showing a set of layers for the cat icon"
    width={381}
  />
</p>

You can now convert this icon into a component with <Kbd mod={['option',
'meta']}>K</Kbd>. Returning to your keycap component, select the component
instance within it called `18px/Control Symbol`, and then at the top of the
right-hand panel click _Control Symbol_ to reveal the popover for _Swap
instance_. From the dropdown within this popover, select _Created in this file_,
then type `18px/` and the new icon should appear in the popover, so click to
select it.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src={figmaSwapInstanceCatIcon}
    alt="A screenshot of the Figma interface showing the Swap instance popover"
    width={510}
  />
</p>

Your component should then update, and if you handled the naming and Boolean
union correctly, the icon will automatically use the existing modifier color —
this is particularly useful for avoiding the need to update all your instances
whenever you change their icons.

## Modifier Text

:::warning

KAP Legend System makes use of heavily-modified letterforms, which have been
individually tweaked at different scales to meet engineering constraints. They
require careful alignment, both to be correctly positioned and to ensure the
gaps between letters is sufficient for manufacture. As such, there isn’t an
individual font you can install to create custom text legends of the same
quality as the default legends. For now, the easiest way to get custom modifier
text onto a key is to reach out to **kapowaz** on <DiscordLink /> with the
specific legends you need to be created so they can be supplied to you.

:::

## Tolerances

There are several important engineering tolerances you must stick to when
creating custom legends — whether they’re icons, custom art or custom text.
These are important to ensure that your design can be physically manufactured
and turned into an insert for injection molding. The five key metrics you should
pay attention to are:

1. **Line width** — the width of individual strokes on letters or icons
2. **R-angle** — the smallest possible radius of _internal_ corners within a
   legend
3. **Interval** — the gap between individual stroked or filled elements within a
   legend
4. **Enclosed area** — the size of any internal gaps within legends, e.g. the
   centre of a letter O
5. **Icon area** — the relative proportion of the keycap legend that is filled

For each of these tolerances values are listed both in millimetres and pixels,
the latter being the value you should use in Figma.

### Line width

The width of individual strokes on letters or icons. Note that the standard
stroke width for icons and most legends is `0.5mm` (`1.42px` in Figma); for
consistency you should usually aim to use this value for your strokes.

<p align="center">
  <img src={toleranceLineWidth} alt="Line width tolerance" width={280} />
</p>

- Ideal: `>0.5mm` / `1.42px`
- Good: `>0.32mm` / `0.91px`
- Difficult `>0.22mm` / `0.62px`

Stroke widths below `0.22mm` in thickness might be possible, but should be
avoided.

### R-Angle

This metric concerns the sharpness of any internal corners on your legend. It is
best visualised as the corner radius on a sharp point, measured in `mm`. You can test this
in design tools by checking if a circle with the desired radius can fit snugly
inside the internal corner, covering the whole area the corner extends into.

<p align="center">
  <img src={toleranceRAngle} alt="R-angle tolerance" width={280} />
</p>

- Ideal: `>0.6mm` / `1.7px`
- Good: `>0.3mm` / `0.85px`
- Difficult: `>0.1mm` / `0.28px`

Corner radii below `0.1mm` should be avoided.

### Interval

Similar to line width, this is a simple metric for the gap between filled areas
within a legend. You can test whether your legends meet this requirement by
creating a circle of the chosen diameter and seing whether there are any places
within your legend where it can overlap two separate elements of the legend
simultaneously.

<p align="center">
  <img src={toleranceInterval} alt="Interval tolerance" width={280} />
</p>

- Good: `>0.5mm` / `1.42px`
- Difficult: `>0.3mm` / `0.85px`

Interval gaps of below `0.3mm` between filled areas should be avoided.

### Enclosed Area

To ensure legend molds can be manufactured, the size of non-filled, enclosed
areas should be above a certain minimum size.

<p align="center">
  <img src={toleranceEnclosedArea} alt="Enclosed area tolerance" width={280} />
</p>

- Ideal: `>1mm` / `2.84px`
- Good: `>0.5mm` / `1.42px`
- Difficult: `>0.25mm` / `0.71px`

Enclosed areas below `0.25mm` wide between filled areas should be avoided.

#### Icon Area

This relates to the _relative proportion_ of the keycap legend that is filled
compared to the base keycap color. Provided your legend doesn’t fill a large
amount of the keycap surface you should be comfortably within this constraint,
but it should be given consideration to if you have an especially large legend
for any reason.

<p align="center">
  <img src={toleranceIconArea} alt="Icon area tolerance" width={280} />
</p>

- Ideal: `<10%`
- Good: `<60%`
- Difficult: `<80%`

### Safe Area

As well as tolerance constraints, custom legends must be a safe distance from
the edge of the keycap top surface. When creating custom legends you must ensure
that your legend is no closer than `0.3mm` / `0.85px` to this line.

<p align="center">
  <img src={toleranceSafeArea} alt="Safe area tolerance" width={280} />
</p>

You can visualise this safe area within your individual keycap components by
turning on a (hidden) layer called `Safe Area` within the keycap _Profile_
sub-component. To find this component, <Kbd mod="meta">Click</Kbd> on the main
keycap surface to select the layer called `Inner Edge`; the `Safe Area` should
be immediately below this, but hidden. By default it will be displayed with a
thin cyan-colored stroke, but to accurately indicate the area your legend cannot
encroach upon, you should change the Stroke properties to a width of `1.7`, with
the stroke aligned to the _Inside_ of the layer.
