# Packaging

The KAP Template includes a set of components that can help you easily produce
an attractive packaging design for the outer sleeve of your set’s main Base Kit.
You can update these components within the template file, which will update the
overall sleeve design.

## Requirements

The packaging template has a specific layout and structure that is intended to
help customers easily identify KAP Legend System keycap sets and raise brand
recognition, so elements of the design are common to all KAP sets. As such,
there are certain parts of the packaging template that can be customised, and
other parts which should remain relatively unchanged.

1. Update the box sides within the component `Packaging Side` with your kit name
   (i.e. ‘KAP Your Set Name’). The size and color of this text, the background
   color and the small logos should not be changed (i.e. they should remain
   black and white). No additional design elements should be added to the sides.
   These areas are marked in red on the diagram above.
2. The colors used for the KAP Legend System logo on the box sides can be
   adjusted to suit the remainder of the box design. These areas are marked in
   orange on the diagram above.
3. The layout and design on the box flaps (`Packaging Outer Flap`) should be
   unchanged, although the colors (including background) can be adjusted to suit
   your needs. No additional design elements should be added in this area. These
   areas are marked in orange on the diagram above.
4. The lower section of the box top (`Packaging Top`) should be updated to show
   your kit name, but otherwise the layout and design of this area should be
   unchanged. Again, you can update the colors as you see fit. This area is
   marked in orange on the diagram above.
5. The top section of the box top (`Packaging Top`) can be updated to contain
   whatever design best fits your needs. This area is marked in green on the
   diagram above.
6. The box bottom (`Packaging Bottom`) can contain whatever design suits your
   needs. Note that an area for a `50mm×40mm` barcode sticker has been included;
   this should remain on the bottom of the box, although the location can be
   adjusted to suit your design. This area is marked in green on the diagram
   above.

In general, the rule of thumb based on the colored areas in the diagram above
is:

- **Red** — should be unchanged (except for name of set)
- **Orange** — can have colors customized, but no new design elements
- **Green** — can be customized according to your needs

We realize these constraints might seem particularly restrictive, but they exist
for good reason. As we position the brand of KAP Legend System as a premium
product in the eyes of customers, it’s important that the product has a
consistent, high quality appearance that is easily recognisable. If you have a
box design in mind that doesn’t fit within these constraints, please get in
touch via <DiscordLink /> to discuss your requirements.

## Exporting

Since Figma only works with RGB colors, in order to create a design that is
print ready you will need to export the layer `KAP Template Tray Sleeve Box` (it
is preconfigured to export as SVG), then using another graphic design tool
create a print-ready PDF using either CMYK or spot colors. When making these
changes ensure that the dimensions and positioning of elements remain unchanged;
the base layer of the design should be `398.2mm × 382.3mm`.
