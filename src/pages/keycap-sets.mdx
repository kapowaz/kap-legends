# Keycap Sets

Listed below are the current sets using the KAP Legend System, with details
about colour scheme, modifier types and sublegends etc. If you are designing
your own set with KAP Legend System we recommend checking this list to make sure
it doesn’t overlap too closely with an existing set. This helps increase the
chances of both sets successfully reaching Minimum Order Quantity.

Designers should always be mindful of the risk of designs overlapping and
respect that some ideas won’t be possible to pursue, or need to be put to one
side for a suitable time. We encourage all designers to work in a good faith
environment of collaboration and encouragement.

If you have a set in production and you’d like to add it to the list, please get
in touch via <DiscordLink />. Note that these images are illustrative and not
intended to necessarily represent the kitting or precise colours of the final
shipping product.
